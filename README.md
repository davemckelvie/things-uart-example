## Example Project

This project demonstrates usage of an FTDI USB-Serial converter on the preview image of Android Things.

This uses the serial port api project from [here](https://github.com/cepr/android-serialport-api)

See [here](http://android.geek.nz/i-need-more-uarts-android-things/) for details of getting the FTDI USB-Serial converter working with the preview image of Android Things.

### WARNING: This probably won't work with production versions of Android Things.
